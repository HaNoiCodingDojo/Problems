Problem Statement
=================

**HanoiLUG**, aka *Hanoi's most Lazy, Ugly, and Gross-y*, is a group of
geeks, nerds, gits, otakus, self-obsessed, ... (well, you name it)
people staying, living, and working in Hanoi, the Capital of Vietnam.
Though everyone is in the same group, they don't speak the same
language.  This leads to lots of misunderstandings in communication.

In one beautiful day, *Y@* (or "Wyatt", his last name is "Earp"
probably), an ugly-silly-parenthesis-obsessed member of HanoiLUG, has a
dream.  He doesn't dream about HanoiLUG speaking the same language but
using the same system of numbers.  In his dream, they use the usual
decimal system with a few exceptions: when writing numbers, the word
**Fizz** is used instead of numbers divisible by 3, the word **Buzz**
is used instead of numbers divisible by 5, and the word **FizzBuzz**
is used instead of numbers divisible by both 3 and by 5.  Well, this's
sort of ugly and stupid, and will definitely lead to much more
misunderstandings, but some how he feels happy...

After a while thinking about this, he decides to do some research
about this sort of system.  The problem he states is: given an integer
``N`` whose value does not exceed 100.  Figure out how many **Fizz**
and how many **Buzz** he would find if he writes down all the number
from ``0`` to ``N``.  He makes this the **entrance exam** for anyone
who wants to be a HanoiLUG member.

Now, imagine you want to be a part of the most lazy, ugly and gross-y
people in Hanoi (aka HanoiLUG), you task is the solve the problem
using some language.  All languages are acceptable, including all
Elvish dialects (Sindarin, Quenya, ..., and their writing system
Tengwar), Vulcan's Klingon, etc.

Example: With ``N = 10``, the answer is 6 ``Fizz`` es and 4 ``Buzz``
es.  The sequence we have is:

::

  1
  2
  Fizz
  4
  Buzz
  Fizz
  7
  8
  Fizz
  Buzz
  11
  Fizz
  13
  14
  FizzBuzz
  16
  17
  Fizz
  19
  Buzz
