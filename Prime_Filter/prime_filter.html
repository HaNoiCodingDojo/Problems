<li>The following numbers are not prime numbers: 0, 1, 4, 10, 24, ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a list of numbers, find out which numbers are prime numbers and
return the list of them in ascending order.  Elements in the result
list are not duplicated (see examples below).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>Input:  '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
Output: '(2 3 5 7)

Input:  '(12 2 5 12 10 5)
Output: '(2 5)

Input:  '(10 20 30 20 10)
Output: '()
</code></pre>
